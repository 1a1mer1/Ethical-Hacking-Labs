# Social Engineering
Social engineering is the art of manipulating people so they give up confidential information. The types of information these criminals are seeking can vary, but when individuals are targeted the criminals are usually trying to trick you into giving them your passwords or bank information, or access your computer to secretly install malicious softwareâ€“that will give them access to your passwords and bank information as well as giving them control over your computer.

[McAfee's whitepaper "Hacking the Humanos Operating System"](https://community.mcafee.com/t5/Documents/Hacking-the-Human-Operating-System-Raj-Samani/ta-p/550808?attachment-id=6539) focuses on the use of social engineering to attack home and business users and finds once again that people are the weakest link. The McAfee report points out that there are many organizations who develop and deliver user awareness programs into their business areas, but the effectiveness of such programs varies, and in some identified cases, even after the security training has been delivered, it has done very little to educate their end users with any valued security awareness to mitigate the threat of the social engineering attack.
