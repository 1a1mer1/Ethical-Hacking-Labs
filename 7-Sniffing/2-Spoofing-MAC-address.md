# MAC Address spoofing
MAC spoofing is a technique for changing a factory-assigned Media Access Control (MAC) address of a network interface on a networked device. The MAC address that is hard-coded on a network interface controller (NIC) cannot be changed. However, many drivers allow the MAC address to be changed. Additionally, there are tools which can make an operating system believe that the NIC has the MAC address of a user's choosing. The process of masking a MAC address is known as MAC spoofing. Essentially, MAC spoofing entails changing a computer's identity, for any reason, and it is relatively easy.

* Alfa network adapter. [[+]](https://kennyvn.com/best-wireless-adapters-kali-linux/)
* Windows 7, 8 or 10 virtual machine.
* Windows Server 2012 or 2016 virtual machine.

## Using `macchanger` in Kali
Macchanger is a tool that is included with any version of Kali Linux including the 2016 rolling edition and can change the MAC address to any desired address until the next reboot. In this lab we will be spoofing the MAC address of our wireless adapter with a random MAC address generated by **Macchanger on Kali Linux.**

## SMAC
SMAC is a powerful and easy-to-use tool for MAC address changer (spoofer). The tool can activate a new MAC address right after changing it automatically.
