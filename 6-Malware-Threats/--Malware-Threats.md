Malware / Malicious Software is a type of program that contains malicious or harmful code embedded inapparently harmless programming or data in such a way that it can take control of a system or its operations and cause damage, such as running the file allocation table on a hard drive.


Malware poses a major security threat to the information security. Malware writers explore new attack vectors to exploit vulnerabilities in information systems. This leads to ever more sophisticated malware attacks, including drive by malware, 'maladvertising' (or 'malvertising'), Advanced Persistent Threats (APT), and so on. Though organizations try hard to  defend themselves using comprehensive security policies and advanced anti-malware controls, the current trend indicates that malware applications are targeting 'lower-hanging fruit': undersecured smartphones, mobile applications, social media, and cloud services. The problem is further complicated because of threat predictions. As McAfee stated in its McAfee Labs Threats Report published in December 2017, 'The biggest number of the quarter is our count of new malware, which reached an all-time high of 57.6 million new samples, an increase of 10% from Q2. The total count in the McAfee Labs sample databases is now more than 780 million. New ransomware rose by 36% this quarter, largely from widespread Android screen-locking malware. The easy availability of exploit kits and dark web sources fuel the rapid creation of new malware'.
