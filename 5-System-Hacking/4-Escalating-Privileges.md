# Escalating Privileges

Privilege Escalation is the demonstration of misusing a bug, configuration imperfection, or design oversight in a working framework or programming application to increase lifted access to assets that are regularly shielded from an application or client.

Once attackers gain access to the target system, they start looking for different ways to escalate their privilege in the system. They can exploit vulnerability, design flaw or configuration oversight in the OS or software applications on the target system to gain elevated access to resources that are normally protected from an application or user. The privilege escalation can be **vertical** or **lateral**.

### Objectives
* Demonstrate how to escalate privileges on a victim machine by exploiting its vulnerabilities.

### Requisites
* Kali Linux virtual machine.
* Windows 10 virtual machine.
